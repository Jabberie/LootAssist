# LootAssist

This addon is geared towards Multiboxers but can be very useful for any character.
 
While multiboxing I've gone from mashing my IWT multiple times with a LootClose macro to pressing IWT once and almost always being complete within 2 seconds.
Herbing the same node on 5 characters and all 5 getting their materials immediately.
On a single character, everything gets hoovered up quickly. 
Features
LootAssist deactivated your loot window thus speeding up the initial loot times as the window does not need to load. 
LootAssist attempts to loot repeatedly if it get Item is Busy error when looting an item. Quite common when multiple characters attempt to loot a single item at the same time. Example- quest item from a rare mob. This means you do not end up with a stuck item and always get it. 
LootAssist will list to the chat window if you left without looting an item. If you leave before that busy item eventually got to you, you get a message saying what was left behind. While annoying, it's a very good example; leaving ancient mana behind. 
LootAssist has an Account wide default setting and individual character settings so you do not have to have it active on all characters.
